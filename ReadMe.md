# Introduction

This is another version of movie theater application that is built using Spring Boot 3.0 and JDK 17. No new features
from Spring Boot 3.0 are used but Records from Java 17 are used. Also, some Streams methods used are available
only in JDK 17.

It applies a number of good coding practices (e.g. Single Responsibility Principle, Immutable Objects, Code to interface
etc.) to solve the problem of movie reservation fee calculation.

### Instructions To Run The Code

* Use the appropriate tool (GitHub Desktop, Git Bash, IDE) to get the code from GitHub to your local machine

* Go to the root directory where the project was downloaded (pom.xml should be in this directory)
* Run the following command: <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code>
* Enter the inputs and verify results
* You can also do the above steps directly from your IDE
